                    <p class="text slide-in-bottom2">When people say that their team is “like a family,” it can make you think different things. Some families fight,
                         some families barely talk at all. But a good family is one that supports each other, that functions as a unit when they need
                          to, but all have individual interests. That sounds like what Raven SMP is - a bunch of people with one common interest, Minecraft,
                           coming together to help each other achieve more than they could on their own. That’s a good family.</p> <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/survival-stories"><p class="slide-in-bottom2">-Minecraft.net</p></a>
